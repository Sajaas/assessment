Q: How do you initialize rspec in a folder? Do it in our cars folder.
A:  1. Touch Gemfile, add source ‘http://rubysorce.com’, gem ‘rspec’
    2. rspec --init

Q: We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass. Why?
A: Partly because it makes the code easier to test. Partly because it requires you to write simpler and more structured code, which makes it easier to read.
